This project consists of a web app deployed using Google Scripts, and a set of Python and Javascript files to update the data in the sanction leaderboard.
Each brother has 5 excuses at the start of the semester. There is an excuse form that can be filled out when someone needs to miss an event. This must be submitted at least a day before the event, and this is validated by the Python program.

Once that is checked, The program pulls the current sanction and excuse balance for each member. Once attendance for an event is submitted, those that have an unexcused absence will receive the specified sanction amount. The data is updated and the google sheet containing the information as well. All sanctions are live and reflected on the sanctions website.
